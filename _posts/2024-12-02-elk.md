Parallel computation has enabled the deep learning revolution. In sequence modeling, transformers and deep SSMs (linear RNNs) have become dominant, in part because they can be parallelized over the sequence length, allowing them set modern parallelized hardware (GPUs/TPUs) to work on long sequences. In contrast, it was thought that evaluating nonlinear RNNs was inherently sequential.
**But nonlinear RNNs can be parallelized too!** We show you how in this blog post.
