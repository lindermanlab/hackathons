Structured VAEs ([Johnson et al, 2016](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6379-composing-graphical-models-with-neural-networks-for-structured-representations-and-fast-inference)) combine probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and neural networks in one deep generative model, but they're pretty tricky to implement. We show how to build them using TensorFlow Probability and JAX!
